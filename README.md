# Prime-Number-Multiplication-Table
Generate the first N prime numbers and makes a multiplication table based off of them. You can add more values to an already existing set by utilzing the existing functionality.

## Getting Started
This project was built in Xcode using C++. There are no additional dependencies required since only the built in libraries were used.
If you have Xcode, simply click the .xcodeproj file to open the project in the environment to run or build it.
Otherwise, all the files are in the folder labeled "Primes Number Multiplication Table" and add those to your C++ project and build it in the environment of your choice.

## Running the tests

6 test cases are already created in the TestTenPrimes class. Simply creating an object of that class and calling the RunTest function will run the tests.

### Test Cases

Test cases for this program are for checking the edge cases and the middle case for prime number generation and the multiplication table.
